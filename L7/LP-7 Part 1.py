Theoritical Session

The main aim of the session is to get the kid prepared for the comming lessons on data-analysis and machine learning.
The kid needs to understand the concept well. Try to avoid the mathematical explanation as far as possible.

The concepts to be discussed are as follows - 
1) What is Machine Learning ?
2) Applications of Machine Learning in real world
3) Types of Machine Learning - 
    a) Supervised Learning
    b) Unsupervised Learning
    c) Reinforcement Learning
    # Explain the concept of each type of machine leanring with real life scenarios / examples

4) Types of Machine Learning Problems - 
    a) Regeression
    b) Classification
    c) Recommendation
    # Explain the concept of each problem type with real life scenarios / examples

5) Steps to be followed in a Machine Leanring Project - 
    a) Gathering the data and load the data into the program
    b) Data Preprocessing - prepare the data for further machine learning projects
    c) Data Analysis - Analyse the data so that you can define your input and output columns and drop the rest
    d) Define Input and Output - Create separate dataframes for input - output 
    e) Perform the test-train split - Split up the data into testing and training data , Explain the use of training and testing data
    f) Select the machine learning algorithm perform the training of the model.
    g) Perform predictions and compare the predictions with actual result to calculate accuracy.

    # Breifly explain the use and concept behind the steps, explain terms such as accuracy, predictions etc which are used in above steps

1) What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves creating algorithms that enable systems to learn and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of explicitly programmed instructions, machine learning models learn patterns and relationships from data, improving their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.

2) Applications of Machine Learning in the Real World
Machine learning finds applications across various industries, such as:

Healthcare: Diagnosis prediction, personalized treatment plans
Finance: Fraud detection, risk assessment, algorithmic trading
Marketing: Customer segmentation, recommendation systems
Automotive: Autonomous vehicles, predictive maintenance
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Language translation, sentiment analysis
3) Types of Machine Learning:
a) Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the input and output are known. For example, predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., using historical housing data where prices are labeled.

b) Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, finding patterns or structures within the data. An example is clustering similar customer behavior from transaction data without predefined categories.

c) Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning uses a reward-based system where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. For instance, training a robot to navigate a maze, rewarding it for correct movements and penalizing wrong ones.

4) Types of Machine Learning Problems:
a) Regression
Regression involves predicting continuous values. For example, predicting the price of a house, given its features.

b) Classification
Classification is about predicting discrete categories or classes. For instance, classifying emails as spam or not spam based on their content.

c) Recommendation
Recommendation systems predict preferences or ratings. An example is suggesting movies based on a user's previous choices or ratings.

5) Steps in a Machine Learning Project:
a) Gathering and Loading Data
Collect relevant data and load it into the program.

b) Data Preprocessing
Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.

c) Data Analysis
Understand the data's structure, relationships, and patterns to inform model creation.

d) Define Input and Output
Separate data into input and output variables to train the model.

e) Test-Train Split
Divide data into training and testing sets to train the model on a subset and evaluate its performance on another.

f) Select Algorithm & Train Model
Choose an appropriate algorithm and train the model using the training data.

g) Predictions and Evaluation
Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data and evaluate its accuracy by comparing predictions with actual results.

Key Terms:
Accuracy: The measure of the model's correctness in making predictions.
Predictions: Model's forecasted outcomes based on input data.
Test-Train Split: Dividing data for training and evaluation to assess model performance.
Each step plays a crucial role in building a successful machine learning model, from data collection to model evaluation and deployment.
